# Typing Speed Test - README

Overview

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test web application! This is a simple static website that allows users to measure their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) by typing a randomly generated passage within a set time. The project is designed to be minimalistic, user-friendly, and accessible to all. It has been deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) as a static site.

Features

- Typing Speed Measurement: Calculates words per minute (WPM) based on the user's typing speed.
- Randomized Text Passages: Provides a variety of sample text passages for users to type.
- Timer: Allows users to see the time remaining while they type.
- Real-time Feedback: Displays the number of words typed correctly and provides the final score upon completion.
- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

This project is a static website, so no backend or database is required. You only need a modern web browser to run the site locally or on any hosting platform.

Hosting Platform

The website is hosted on Render. You can access it using the following link:

https://typing-speed-test-f09l.onrender.com

Local Development

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-speed-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd typing-speed-test
   ```

3. Open the HTML File:
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser by double-clicking on it or using the following command:
   ```bash
   start index.html  # Windows
   ```

You should now see the Typing Speed Test running in your browser.

Project Structure

```bash
typing-speed-test/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the website
├── style.css         # CSS for styling the website
├── script.js         # JavaScript for functionality (e.g., timer, typing test logic)
└── assets/           # Optional directory for images, icons, etc.
```

 Files Overview

- index.html: Contains the structure and layout of the webpage.
- style.css: Styles the elements of the page to make the site visually appealing.

 How to Use

1. Start the Test : Once you open the website, click on the "Start Test" button to begin.
2. Typing: A random passage will appear, and a timer will start. Type the text exactly as shown.
3. View Results: After the time is up, your WPM, accuracy, and other metrics will be displayed.
4. Restart: Click on the "Restart" button to try again with a new passage.
